# Clustering-in-Python :snake: :metal:

This is a Python exercise that was originally created for a Principles of Geocomputing course to demostrate a couple spatial use cases of the sklearn Python package in Jupyter Notebooks. The exercise demonstrates the basic functionality of unsupervised spatial clustering. These include two different clustering methods including K-Means and DBSCAN. 


The dataset was downloaded from Airbnb's website :earth_americas:, and it can be found here http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. More datasets are available via their website. Feel free to download the repository or use the environment created through Binder located above. (See Button) 

Happy Coding!
