# Clustering-in-Python

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/E-Cole-I/Clustering-in-Python/master)    Use this to launch the Docker Environment!


This is a Python exercise that was originally created for a Principles of Geocomputing course to demostrate use cases of sklearn in Jupyter Notebooks. The exercise touches base on two different clustering methods including K-Means and DBSCAN. The dataset was downloaded from Airbnb's website, and it can be found here http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. Feel free to download the repository or use the environment created through Binder located above. (See Button)
