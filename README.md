# Clustering-in-Python :snake: :metal: 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/E-Cole-I/Clustering-in-Python/master)    &nbsp;Use this to launch the Docker Environment!  :octocat:   


This is a Python exercise that was originally created for a Principles of Geocomputing course to demostrate use cases of sklearn in Jupyter Notebooks. This was only meant to demonstrate unsupervised learning in an easy to understand way. The exercise itself touches base on two different clustering methods including K-Means and DBSCAN in a spatial sense. The dataset was downloaded from Airbnb's website :earth_americas:, and it can be found here http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. More datasets are available via their website. Feel free to download the repository or use the environment created through Binder located above. (See Button) 

Happy Coding!
